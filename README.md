# Datathon


## Ideas:
- Use temporal info and geospatial information to visualize patterns in success
- heatmaps of action
- Data Preprocessing:

- Combine the "AED Locations" dataset with the "Interventions BXL" and "Interventions" datasets to get a comprehensive understanding of where cardiac emergencies have occurred historically.
Analyze the historical geolocation data of heart attacks to identify patterns, such as high-traffic areas, densely populated regions, areas with higher incidences of cardiac emergencies, etc.
Identify High-Risk Areas:

- Use clustering algorithms or heatmaps to identify regions with a high frequency of cardiac emergencies. These areas are likely to benefit the most from additional AED placements.
Evaluate Existing AED Locations:

- Assess the effectiveness of existing AED locations. Evaluate factors such as proximity to high-risk areas, accessibility, coverage gaps, and usage frequency.
Optimization Algorithm:

- Develop an optimization algorithm that considers various factors such as population density, distance to medical facilities, response time of emergency services, and historical data on heart attacks.
This algorithm should aim to maximize coverage while minimizing response time to cardiac emergencies.
Simulation and Validation:

- Use simulation techniques to validate the effectiveness of the proposed AED placements.
Simulate hypothetical scenarios of cardiac emergencies and assess the response time based on the optimized AED placements.
Continuous Monitoring and Updating:

- Implement a system for continuous monitoring and updating of AED placements based on real-time data on cardiac emergencies.
Utilize feedback loops to improve the optimization algorithm over time based on the effectiveness of AED placements.
Collaboration with Stakeholders:

- Collaborate with local authorities, healthcare professionals, and community organizations to ensure buy-in and support for the optimized AED placement strategy.
Involve stakeholders in the decision-making process to address specific needs and considerations of different regions within Belgium.
